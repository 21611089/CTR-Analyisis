The research article, titled "Navigating the Clickscape: Understanding the Impact of Ad Placement on Click-Through Rates," investigates the influence of advertisement placement on a website's click-through rates (CTR). The study, published in the International Journal of Digital Marketing, was conducted over a two-week period on a prominent news website. The primary focus was on analyzing CTRs for a newly introduced sports footwear brand named "ZoomRunners." The ZoomRunners ads were strategically placed in three distinct locations on the website: the left sidebar, the center of the page within the content, and the right sidebar.

To mitigate time-of-day bias, each ad location was alternated every three hours throughout the study. The website layout was designed to emulate a realistic browsing experience by incorporating various other advertisements and content. CTRs, measured as the number of clicks per hundred views, were recorded for the ZoomRunners ads at the three different locations over the ten-day study period.

The objective is to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in the average CTR based on the ad placement on the website, using a significance level of 0.05. As a Digital Marketing Analyst tasked with creating an interactive tool, the project involves using R and the Shiny package to develop an application. This tool enables users to input their own data, assess the impact of product ad placements on CTR, and explore whether the insights gained could be generalized to other forms of digital advertisements across diverse website layouts. The application includes features such as text input or file upload options, statistical analysis capabilities, visualizations of CTR performance by ad placement, and a summary output communicating the results of the statistical analysis. The overarching goal is to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of product placement strategies in the digital marketing domain.
